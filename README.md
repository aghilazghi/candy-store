# candy-store
Candy Store is a full stack application which I develped while I was taking an ASP.NET Core 3 MVC course on Udemy.  It is an E-Commerce application and was built using ASP.NET Core 3 MVC, C#, Entity Framework Core 3, and Bootstrap.
Some of the features in which the application incorporates:
-Tag Helpers
-Dependency Injection
-Partial Views
-Repository Pattern
-Sessions
-Authencation and authorization
